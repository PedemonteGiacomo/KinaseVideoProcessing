# Testing Examples

## üß™ Step-by-Step Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Pipeline Test

**Objective**: Verify the complete pipeline works end-to-end

**Steps**:
1. Deploy infrastructure
2. Wait for Fargate task to complete
3. Run consumer
4. Verify results

**Expected Results**:
- 5 processed frames in S3
- 5 messages in SQS (consumed by consumer)
- YOLO detections displayed by consumer

### Scenario 2: Custom Image Test

**Objective**: Test with your own images

**Steps**:
1. Replace `fargate_service/sample.jpg` with your image
2. Rebuild Docker image:
   ```powershell
   cd fargate_service
   docker build -t yolo-processor:latest .
   ```
3. Push to ECR and redeploy ComputeStack
4. Run consumer

**Expected Results**:
- Better object detections with real photos
- Different object classes detected

### Scenario 3: Monitor Real-time Processing

**Objective**: Watch the processing happen live

**Steps**:
1. Start consumer before deployment:
   ```powershell
   python cli_consumer/consume.py --queue <queue-url> --wait
   ```
2. Deploy ComputeStack
3. Watch live updates in consumer

**Expected Results**:
- Real-time processing updates
- Frame-by-frame results

## üìä Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Deployed
- [ ] NetworkStack: VPC created
- [ ] StorageStack: S3 buckets + SQS queue created
- [ ] StreamStack: Kinesis Video Stream created
- [ ] EcrStack: ECR repository created
- [ ] ComputeStack: Fargate service running

### ‚úÖ Docker Image
- [ ] Image builds successfully
- [ ] Image pushed to ECR
- [ ] Fargate can pull image

### ‚úÖ Processing
- [ ] Fargate task starts
- [ ] Task completes successfully
- [ ] CloudWatch logs show processing output
- [ ] No error messages in logs

### ‚úÖ Results
- [ ] Processed frames appear in S3
- [ ] Messages appear in SQS
- [ ] Consumer receives and processes messages
- [ ] Objects detected and displayed

## üîç AWS Console Verification

### Check S3 Bucket
1. Go to S3 Console
2. Find bucket named `processedframebucket-...`
3. Navigate to date folder (e.g., `2025-07-01/`)
4. Verify frame images exist

### Check SQS Queue
1. Go to SQS Console
2. Find queue named `ProcessedFrameQueue`
3. Check "Messages available" count
4. Use "Send and receive messages" to view message content

### Check ECS Task
1. Go to ECS Console
2. Click on "YoloCluster"
3. Go to "Tasks" tab
4. Check task status (should be STOPPED after completion)
5. Click on task ‚Üí "Logs" to see processing output

### Check CloudWatch Logs
1. Go to CloudWatch Console
2. Click "Log groups"
3. Find `/aws/ecs/YoloService`
4. View log streams for processing output

## üêõ Common Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Run
```
CloudWatch Logs:
Starting video processing from stream: video-input-stream
Processed frame 0, found 2 objects
Processed frame 1, found 3 objects
Processed frame 2, found 1 objects
Processed frame 3, found 2 objects
Processed frame 4, found 3 objects
Video processing complete. Processed 5 frames

Consumer Output:
Processing message: {...}
Downloaded frame_0_abc123.jpg from S3
Detected objects: 2
- person (confidence: 0.85)
- car (confidence: 0.92)
```

### ‚ùå No Objects Detected
```
CloudWatch Logs:
Starting video processing from stream: video-input-stream
Processed frame 0, found 0 objects
...

This is normal for synthetic test images.
Try with real photos containing people, cars, etc.
```

### ‚ùå S3 Permission Error
```
CloudWatch Logs:
botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the PutObject operation

Solution: Verify task role has S3 write permissions
```

### ‚ùå Container Won't Start
```
ECS Console: Task keeps stopping with exit code

1. Check CloudWatch logs for Python errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check if image exists in ECR
```

## üìà Performance Expectations

### Processing Time
- **Single frame**: ~2-3 seconds
- **5 frames total**: ~10-15 seconds
- **Cold start**: Additional 30-60 seconds for container startup

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: 1 vCPU (1024 CPU units)
- **Memory**: 2GB (2048 MiB)
- **Storage**: Minimal (images are small)

### Cost Estimates (US East 1)
- **Fargate**: ~$0.01 per run (15 minutes)
- **S3**: ~$0.001 for storage
- **SQS**: ~$0.001 for messages
- **NAT Gateway**: ~$0.15 per day (most expensive!)

**Total per test**: ~$0.02 (excluding NAT Gateway)

## üéØ Success Criteria

A successful test run should demonstrate:

1. **Infrastructure**: All stacks deploy without errors
2. **Container**: Docker image builds and runs successfully
3. **Processing**: Video frames processed with YOLO detections
4. **Storage**: Processed frames stored in S3
5. **Messaging**: Results sent to SQS and consumed
6. **Monitoring**: Logs available in CloudWatch

Remember to clean up with `cdk destroy --all` after testing!
